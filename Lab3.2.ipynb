      "\n",
      "\"Not to call tight. You didn't show it, and after a time you went to\n",

      "Mr. Davis and Commander Tolan came in. That would be a little after\n",
      "three o'clock, sir. They made some talk about how you were sleeping\n",
      "through the noise they made, that it would take a bomb to wake you.\n",
      "Then, sir, I guess you had some kind of a dream. You began talking like\n",
      "and thrashing with your arms and making noises. So Commander Tolan he\n",
      "said, 'Jesus we can't drink with that going on' and went and shook you\n",
      "by the shoulder until you woke up. You'd been dreaming all right, Mr.\n",
      "Tompkins, because you talked wild when you woke up, about Alaska and\n",
      "where were you. The others joked a bit about it after you left but I'd\n",

      "\"Of course, sir. How much will you need?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A couple of hundred will do,\" I told him, \"if you have that much.\"\n",

      "He nearly caught me. Signing checks was something I simply could not do\n",

      "in the guest-room at Bedford Hills, the previous evening, and found\n",
      "that my original signature as Frank E. Jacklin was completely unchanged\n",
      "by my transmigration, and that my own copy-desk scrawl was the only\n",
      "handwriting I could commit. I had burned the note-paper on which I had\n",
      "made the crucial experiments and flushed the ashes down the toilet. One\n",
      "of my objects in coming to the Pond had been to see if I couldn't get\n",
      "money by simply initialing a chit.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hastily looked in my bill-fold. There was still a fair amount of\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Never mind, after all,\" I told Tammy. \"I guess I have enough to last\n",

      "seen me since Monday and don't know where I am.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very good, sir,\" he agreed. \"I'll take any messages that come for you,\n",
